Backends
-----------------------------------------------

To select a backend, simply change to the backend
directory, compile it, and install it.

Note that the vpopmail source must have been built
first.

Compiling
-----------------------------------------------

To compile a module, run the following command:

   ./configure [options]

For available options, please use:

   ./configure --help

Most users will simply type:

   ./configure

After the configure process has completed, you may
build the module with the following command:

   make

After the module has compiled, install, and make it
active with the following command:

   make install

The module is now installed and active.

Notes
-------------------------------------------------

Some modules, such as the MySQL and LDAP modules
require you to configure database authentication
information in a file, while others require you
to modify a source header.  Please refer to the
specific module's documentation for more information.
