Need to support -x option in vadddomain that sets the delete option when
the qmail-default is created.

vadddomain may not actually support Bounce. I see where it is set, but not 
where it is used.

add .skel directories to the add domain process.  Allow directories to
be specified at system and domain levels.


Consider enforcing MAX_DOM_ALIAS when adding aliases.  If it does not already exist
consider adding a domain limit on how many aliases that is <= MAX_DOM_ALIAS.
MAX_DOM_ALIAS controls the size of structures, and causes a stack overflow if
too many aliases exist, currently there are no tests that protect against this.

Look for various MAX_BUFF BUFF_SIZE declarations, including making qmailadmin use
the same definitions as vpopmail.
